## Notes & Limitations

- Reddit's API has rate limits. If you encounter errors, try again later.
- The qualitiy of analysis depends on available Reddit discussions.
- Very new or obscure products may have limited data available.
- The tool is designed for product reviews and may not work well for other topics.
- Running some queries can take 30-60 seconds depending on the amount of data.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: `Error connecting to server`

- Make sure server.py is running in a separate terminal

**Issue**: `Rate limit exceeded`

- Reddit API enforces rate limits - wait 5-10 minutes before trying again

**Issue**: `No genuine reviews found`

- Try broadening your search query or checking spelling
- Some products might just not have many Reddit discussions

## Requirements ðŸ“¦

- Python 3.8+
- MCP library
- Reddit API credentials
- Groq API key (for LLM analysis)

## Future plans

- Add multi-platform support (Twitter, Amazon reviews, etc)
- Implement visual charts and graphs for results
- Create a web UI for easier interaction
- Add export options (CSV, PDF reports)
